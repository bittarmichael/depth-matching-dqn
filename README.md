1. dmpt.py is the main file that allows for the training and testing of the results. I have included some of the test data in the test data folder as our data required permission to be shared. 

2. There are two argument variables -test which has a value of False by default. and -train_again which if you want to load your model and train from the last checkpoint. 

3. Download the weights.zip folder from 'releases' and put into the root folder

4. To test the results of our model simply run in the terminal "python dmpt.py -test=True"
